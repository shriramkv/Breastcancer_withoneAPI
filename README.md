# Breastcancer_withoneAPI
The entire implementation has been carried out with the intel oneAPI. 
A logistic regression model to identify correlations between the following 9 independent variables and the class of the tumor (benign or malignant).

a. Clump thickness
b. Uniformity of cell size
c. Uniformity of cell shape
d. Marginal adhesion
e. Single epithelial cell
f. Bare Nuclei
g. Bland chromatin
h. Normal nucleoli
i. Mitoses

Logistic regression can identify important predictors of breast cancer using odds ratios and generate confidence intervals that provide additional information for decision-making. Model performance depends on the ability of the radiologists to accurately identify findings on mammograms.
Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn is a seamless way to speed up your Scikit-learn application. The acceleration is achieved through the use of the Intel(R) oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL). Patching scikit-learn makes it a well-suited machine learning framework for dealing with real-life problems.
